</p><p>Cheney, who lost support from fellow GOP leaders in recent weeks amid a public feud with former President Donald Trump, said her stand was driven by a "reverence for the rule of law." In a scathing six-minute speech, the Wyoming Republican said Trump "risks inciting further violence" and had "misled" millions of Americans with disproven claims that the results of the 2020 presidential election were fraudulent.</p><p>"This is not about policy. This is not about partisanship. This is about   our duty as Americans," Cheney said. "Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar. I will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former presidentâ€™s crusade to undermine our democracy."</P>
